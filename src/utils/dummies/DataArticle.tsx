            <p><strong>React Native</strong> is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that enables developers to build mobile applications for both iOS and Android using a single codebase. Unlike traditional mobile development approaches that require separate codebases for each platform, React Native allows you to write once and deploy on multiple platforms, saving both time and resources.</p>
            
            <p>The framework leverages <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>React</strong> to create interactive user interfaces. React Native makes use of native components, meaning that it renders real native views rather than webviews, which allows for high performance and a native feel. Additionally, React Native provides developers access to a wide range of native APIs and libraries, allowing for deep integration with platform features like the camera, GPS, and more.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Advantages of React Native:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cross-Platform Development:</strong> Write once and deploy on both iOS and Android.</li>
                <li><strong>Hot Reloading:</strong> See code changes instantly without rebuilding the entire app.</li>
                <li><strong>Native Performance:</strong> Access native APIs for better performance and integration.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Community:</strong> A large ecosystem of libraries, tools, and resources.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Companies like <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Airbnb</strong>, and even <strong>Tesla</strong> have successfully used React Native to build production-level apps, demonstrating its reliability and scalability.</p>

            <p><strong>Flutter</strong> is an open-source UI framework developed by <strong>Google</strong> for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses <strong>Dart</strong>, a programming language developed by Google, and provides a fast and expressive way to build user interfaces with a reactive framework.</p>
            
            <p>One of the key features of Flutter is its ability to create high-performance apps. It compiles to native code, which means it provides faster performance than many other cross-platform frameworks that rely on WebViews or JavaScript bridges. Flutter also provides a rich set of pre-built widgets that follow <em>Material Design</em> guidelines (for Android) and <em>Cupertino</em> guidelines (for iOS), making it easy to create apps that look and feel native.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Flutter Architecture:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rendering Engine (Skia):</strong> A high-performance engine that renders widgets and controls every pixel on the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Hot Reload:</strong> Instantly see changes in your app without restarting it, boosting productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Customizable UI:</strong> Full control over the appâ€™s design and animations, making Flutter ideal for complex UIs.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Popular Apps Built with Flutter:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Ads</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Alibaba</strong></li>
                <li><strong>BMW</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Flutter is ideal for developers who want to build high-performance, visually appealing, and highly customized apps across multiple platforms from a single codebase.</p>
